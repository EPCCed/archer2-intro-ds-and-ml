# Practical: Basic PyTorch on ARCHER2

In this practical we'll do some very basic things with PyTorch.

For the purposes of this practical, it's probably most straightforward to install your own version of PyTorch.

Before working through the Jupyter notebook in this directory, please issue the following command to install the necessary files for PyTorch:

```bash
python -m pip install torch torchvision
```
In principle it's possible to use the PyTorch module that's available on ARCHER2 -- see the ARCHER2 docs for more information -- but for the purposes of this course I recommend that you install your own instance.
