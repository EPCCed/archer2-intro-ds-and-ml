This folder contains two different practicals, for us to use depending on (i) the time we have available, and (ii) the extent to which you want to explore the details of KMeans Clustering:

1. The short version shows you how to run clustering with Scikit-learn
2. The longer version explores the algorithm in more depth

(There's nothing in the longer version that's *required* for understanding things later in the course).
