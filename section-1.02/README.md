# Practical: Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks & Pandas

In this initial practical, your goal is to connect to ARCHER2 and open a Jupyter Notebook. Once you are able to do this, you should use the notebook to start working through an exercise from Data Carpentry which introduces Pandas.

**Jupyter Notebooks** provide a useful environment for working with Python interactively. They allow you to store your input and output in a single file which facilitates reproducibility and reuse. They can be useful for **exploratory data analysis** including **visualisation** where the goal is to quickly iterate. 

## Step 1: Open a Jupyter notebook on ARCHER

You should follow the instructions in the [Using Jupyterlab section of the Archer Documentation](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/user-guide/python/#using-jupyterlab-on-archer2). 

## Step 2: Explore some basic data processing using Pandas

Work through [Episode 3](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/02-starting-with-data.html) and [Episode 4](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/03-index-slice-subset.html) from the Data Carpentry course, "[Data Analysis and Visualization in Python for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/python-ecology-lesson/)".

For these introductory exercises, we recommend that you start from a blank Jupyter notebook and type/paste commands from the tutorial pages above.

## Notebooks for the rest of this course

The easiest way to get the notebooks for practicals for the rest of this course is to clone this repository directly on ARCHER2 with the command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EPCCed/archer2-intro-ds-and-ml.git
```
