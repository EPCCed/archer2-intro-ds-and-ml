# Practical: Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks & Pandas

In this initial practical, your goal is to connect to ARCHER and open a Jupyter Notebook. Once you are able to do this, you should use the notebook to start working through an exercise from Data Carpentry which introduces Pandas.

**Jupyter Notebooks** provide a useful environment for working with Python interactively. They allow you to store your input and output in a single file which facilitates reproducibility and reuse. They can be useful for **exploratory data analysis** including **visualisation** where the goal is to quickly iterate 

## Step 1: Open a Jupyter notebook on ARCHER

You should follow the instructions in the [Using Jupyterlab section of the Archer Documentation](https://docs.archer2.ac.uk/user-guide/python/#using-jupyterlab-on-archer2). 

## Step 2: Explore some basic data processing using Pandas

Work through Episode 3 and Episode 4 from the Data Carpetnry course, "Data Analysis and Visualization in Python for Ecologists"
